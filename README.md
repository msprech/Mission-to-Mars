# Mission to Mars Web Scraping Project 

## Purpose: 

Our client is passionate about collecting and distributing news about space exploration, especially in regards to missions to Mars. However, she was looking to create a script that would automate the process of gathering the data into a single location for others to view. We were able to create a script using automation tools such as splinter and beautifulsoup, and visualization tools like flask to scrape data from specified sites. 

## Results:

The final script included an interactive button designed to scrape updated data, including a featured Mars image, the title and summary of a recent article, and pictures of the four different hemispheres. 

The facts table below was also included alongside the featured image.

### Summary: 

This web application also interacts with MongoDB to store and then present information scraped from the different sites using splinter, BeautifulSoup, functions, Flask apps, and html and css elements. 

The final product incorporated reusable functions to fully automate the resulting web application.
